    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The Filter method is a technique for feature selection that evaluates the statistical \n",
    "relationship between each feature and the target variable of interest.\n",
    "It works by computing a statistical score for each feature, indicating how strongly \n",
    "the feature is related to the target variable.\n",
    "The features are then ranked based on their scores, and a subset of the top-ranked \n",
    "features is selected.\n",
    "The number of selected features is determined by a predefined threshold or by \n",
    "cross-validation.\n",
    "The selected features are used for training a machine learning model.\n",
    "The Filter method is computationally efficient as it involves computing the \n",
    "scores of each feature independently.\n",
    "However, it may miss relevant features that are only informative when combined \n",

    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods are techniques for selecting a subset of relevant features \n",
    "during the training of a machine learning model. Here are some common techniques used in \n",
    "embedded feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression: Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization \n",
    "term to the objective function. This regularization term forces some of the coefficients to zero, \n",
    "which results in a sparse model. Lasso regression can be used for feature selection by setting the \n",
    "coefficients of the irrelevant features to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression: Ridge regression is similar to Lasso regression, but it uses a different \n",
    "regularization term. Ridge regression does not set coefficients to zero, but it shrinks the \n",
    "coefficients towards zero. This can be used for feature selection by shrinking the coefficients \n",
    "of the irrelevant features towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic net: Elastic net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regression. It uses both the L1 \n",
    "and L2 regularization terms, which allows it to select a subset of relevant features while \n",
    "also preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees: Decision trees can be used for feature selection by selecting the most important \n",
    "features at each split. The importance of a feature is determined by the reduction in \n",
    "impurity that it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests: Random forests are an ensemble of decision trees. They can be used for feature \n",
    "selection by computing the feature importance across all trees in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting: Gradient boosting is another ensemble method that can be used for \n",
    "feature selection. It works by adding new trees to the ensemble that correct \n",
    "the errors of the previous trees. The feature importance is computed by measuring \n",
    "the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines: Support vector machines (SVMs) can be used for feature selection by \n",
    "selecting the support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary. \n",
    "The features corresponding to the support vectors are considered to be the most important features.\n",
